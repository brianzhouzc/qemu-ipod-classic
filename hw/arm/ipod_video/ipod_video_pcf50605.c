/*
 * NXP PCF50605 power management unit, at I2C address 0x08.
 *
 * Everything the iPod's power supply, its real time clock, its battery gauge
 * and its accessory detection go through. Apple's retailOS will not finish
 * booting without it: 0x28341c starts an A/D conversion and then spins on the
 * result-ready flag with no timeout at all, so with nothing on the bus the
 * firmware simply stops there for ever.
 *
 * Register numbers are from Rockbox's firmware/export/pcf5060x.h ("PCF50605/6
 * Registers from datasheet rev2.2"), cross-checked against OpenMoko's
 * include/pcf50606.h, which was written from the same datasheet.
 *
 * The bus protocol is a plain register-pointer device: a write starts with the
 * register number and the pointer advances after every byte, a read carries on
 * from wherever the pointer was left. That the pointer survives the end of a
 * transaction is not a guess -- both drivers depend on it. Rockbox's
 * i2c_readbytes() sends the register number in one transaction and then reads
 * in separate ones, and Apple's 0x283540 does the same and splits the read
 * into four-byte chunks, so a seven-byte RTC read is one write and two reads
 * with the pointer running across all three.
 *
 * WHAT IS MODELLED
 *
 *   - The register file, which is what almost every register is: the guest
 *     writes regulator voltages, interrupt masks and GPO settings and never
 *     reads them back for anything that matters.
 *   - The A/D converter: ADCC2 starts a conversion and selects the input,
 *     ADCS1/ADCS2 return a 10-bit result with the ready flag.
 *   - The real time clock, from the host clock through QEMU's own -rtc plumbing.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT
 *
 *   - The RTC alarm, 0x11..0x17. Those registers store and read back and
 *     nothing ever fires.
 *   - Charging (MBCC1..3, MBCS1) and the ON/OFF controller (OOCC1, including
 *     GOSTDBY, which is how the guest powers the iPod down). A guest that
 *     writes GOSTDBY here is quietly ignored rather than shutting the machine
 *     down.
 *   - Interrupts. INT1..INT3 stay at zero and the chip's interrupt output is
 *     not wired anywhere. Neither firmware uses the ADC's interrupt; both poll.
 *   - The regulators. Writing DCDC1 does not change any clock or voltage here,
 *     because there is nothing for a voltage to mean.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS, called out because they are not derived from anything:
 *
 *   - The ID register (0x00) reads 0x00. What a real PCF50605 answers there is
 *     not in Rockbox, in iPodLinux, or in OpenMoko's header, and no dump of the
 *     real chip exists. What the firmware needs is only that it is NOT 0x24:
 *     0x283704 compares it against that and switches to a different register
 *     map if it matches (control at 0x30, status at 0x32 -- some other chip).
 *     Any other value behaves identically, so zero is chosen precisely because
 *     it adds no information we do not have.
 *   - The conversion is instantaneous. The real chip takes some time that no
 *     source we have states; all we know is what the firmware waits, which is
 *     20-35 us before it starts polling. Rockbox does not wait at all
 *     (adc-ipod-pcf.c writes ADCC2 and reads ADCS1/ADCS2 straight after), so
 *     the result has to be there by the time the write returns anyway.

/*
 * The battery, as Apple measures it: ADCIN1 through the subtractor. A

 * even though it is the same cell.
 *
 * There is no way to convert this to volts and no need to: the retailOS never
 * does either. 0x264ee8 walks a fifteen-entry table of raw counts and returns
 * the index, and 0x9b24c turns that index into index*256/15. The table for
 * this hardware generation (the top half of the hardware id is 0x000b, which
 * is 11) lives at 0x1081df10 and is put there by the scatter-load, so it can
 * only be read out of a running machine:
 *
 *     283 302 311 317 319 325 330 338 350 365 382 395 404 436 454

 * to bring up a power rail unless the reading is at least 0x12a = 298, out of
 * the literal at 0x264d20.
 *
 * ASSUMPTION: 390 is a choice within what the firmware's own table allows, not
 * a measurement. It sits between entries 10 (382) and 11 (395), so it reports
 * level 11 of 15, comfortably above the 298 that gates the boot and comfortably
 * clear of both ends of the table, where a rounding error either way would
 * change the answer. What 390 is in volts is not known and nothing here
 * depends on knowing it.
